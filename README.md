It's recommended to enable html5 beta test mode on http://youtube.com/html5, then
youtube will use html5 player if it's possible. In other cases this extension
will replace flash video player with embedded html5 player (except those videos,
for which embedding is disallowed by author).

This extension is useful for those, who disabled chrome's built-in flash player
because:

- of its resource usage,
- it's a big hole in your browser,
- it may contain backdoors,
- it may spy you,
- it's proprietary software,
- another reason;

or for users of chromium and it's derivatives, which have no built-in flash
player.

You can install it from [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youhtml5/gjcmlagikdphenildkaeammmeiglkafk).
